# Frontend
* Implement at least three roles with different permission levels:

  * Regular user is able to CRUD on their owned records
  * Manager is able CRUD users
  * Admin is able CRUD all records and users.

* Filter by dates from-to, time from-to (e.g. how much calories have I had for lunch each day in the last month if lunch is between 12 and 15h).

* If they log in using a social media pull the image from their account they used to log in.

# Backend

* REST API. Make it possible to perform all user actions via the API, including authentication (If a mobile application and you donâ€™t know how to create your own backend you can use Firebase.com or similar services to create the API).

* Additionally, provide an option for the user to log in using at least two social media providers (you can pick from Google, Facebook, Twitter, Github, or similar).

* If users log in using a social media pull the image from their account they used to log in.

* Write unit and e2e tests.

* If the number of calories is not provided, the API should connect to a Calories API provider (for example https://www.nutritionix.com) and try to get the number of calories for the entered meal.
